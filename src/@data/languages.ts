Other native speakers included members of draconic-related races, such as dragonborn, members of reptilian races such as lizardfolk, and troglodytes. The language was also used as a primary means of arcane notation throughout Misthalin.",
      "After the creation of the Obelisks in the time before time, the original creatures that existed were dragons - and so, beings that existed for so long learnt to manipulate the Weave. Draconic was a monolithic language, guttural language filled with hissing languages, and it remained almost unchanged since its creation. The only known Draconic language variant was Aragrakh (Old High Wyrm), an ancient draconic language.",

It was described as beautiful, yet alien in nature, since it developed among beings with thought patterns very unlike those of humanity. Some clerics took the time to learn it, but the language was rarely spoken by people on Misthalin, save by the Monastery Of Cuthbert by the plains of Waterdeep.",

As other demons were banished here, the language eventually developed - a twisted bastardisation of Infernal, written in the same script but sounding completely different.",
      "Lower-ranking demons spoke using sounds like the barking of canines, while the speech of more refined demons sounded like softly droning ocean waves mingled with the violence of a swarm of angry hornets. As with everything involving the tanar'ri, however, their speech was unpredictable, and sometimes an elite balor's words were rougher or a lowly bar-lgura's words smoother.",

      "The script was imprinted psionically onto the surface and transmitted the thoughts of the mind flayer that had inscribed it to the reader. It could be written on parchment, in books, or carved into surfaces. Degradation of the material could cause the message to fade over time.",
      "Qualith was extremely difficult to read for non-illithids and usually required magic such as a comprehend languages spell to decipher, because each of the four lines of script modified the others and only when taken as a whole was the full meaning understandable. Readers attempting to non-magically decipher the message, if successful, could gain insight on the writer's thoughts, its meaning, and even who the message was intended for. Failure, however, could drive the reader mad, or at leave them with a bad headache.",
