      "'It is said that Nevermore the Shadow Fiend has the soul of a poet. In fact, he has thousands of them. Over the ages he has claimed the souls of poets, priests, emperors, beggars, slaves, philosophers, criminals, villains and heroes; no sort of soul escapes him. What he does with them is unknown."
      + " No one has ever peered into the Abyss whence Nevermore reaches out like an eel from among astral rocks.",
      "Does he devour them one after another? Does he mount them along the halls of an eldritch temple, or pickle the souls in necromantic brine? Is he merely a puppet, pushed through the dimensional rift by a demonic puppeteer, or is he more than that - a force of the universe itself, simply doing what he must?"

        + " He is a deity that very few know about - one thing is for sure though: many people would have had a less painful afterlife had he not ever existed.",

    description: [
      "In the beginningâ€”and even beforeâ€”chaos was all that existed. Out of it came a number of creatures, including the first demons. A state of raw chaos was intolerable to the universe, so a force arose to combat itâ€”the power of law. From this principle of abstract order, a number of beings coalesced to combat the demons.",
      "These new deities of law suited themselves in gleaming armor made of pure stability and took up weapons forged of ideal thought. Then they waded into battle against the demons. After the battle had raged for uncounted eons, the law deities felt the need to track their progress. They created numbers, to record the enemies slain, and time, so they could see how long victory would take.",
      "Gradually, however, the deities of law began to suspect that the supply of demons was infinite. Weary of battle, they wished to move on to other projects, such as the creation of worlds and intelligent beings. So they made beautiful winged warriors to serve them and wield their divine magic, both in the endless war against the demons and in the worlds yet to be created. These beings, glorious in their diversity, were called angels.",
      "The bravest, toughest, fiercest, and most beautiful of the angels was Asmodeus. He slew more demons than any other of his kindâ€”more even than any deity. But as the eons wore on, Asmodeus and the members of his magnificent and terrible company began to take on some of their enemiesâ€™ traits, so as to fight them more effectively. Gradually, their beauty turned to ugliness, and the deities and other angels began to fear them. Eventually, the inhabitants of the celestial realms petitioned the great gods to banish Asmodeus and the most fearsome of his avenging angels. Asmodeus was banished to Baator, and now resides over therem plotting to overtake everything and everyone. He just needs to find their price.",
      "Asmodeus is the strongest, most cunning, and most handsome of all devils. He is physically stronger than any other devil, and the most cunning and artful. He is typically described as appearing as a giant human, over 13 feet tall, with dark skin and hair, red eyes, handsome features, and small horns on his forehead. He dresses in regal finery of unimaginable expense; a single article of clothing worn by Asmodeus is worth more money than an average nation will spend on food in a year. Beneath his clothing, Asmodeus' body is covered in bloody wounds which he sustained when he fell from the Upper Planes. His wounds ooze blood daily, and any drop of blood which touches the ground grows into a powerful devil. He is described as a 'calm, chillingly reasonable' being with a modest appearance that hides his true power.",
      "Asmodeus never showed himself except through avatars or project image, both in humanoid forms. Asmodeus' avatars looked like a slim, charismatic, red-skinned humanoid over 13â€¯feet (4â€¯meters) tall, with horns on his head and glowing red eyes. Overall, he provided charismatic and beautiful looks that captivated people. He always had a perfectly trimmed beard and wore very expensive red and black clothing, each of these cloths was valuable enough to cover the annual national spending of any nation, and each of his ten avatars held a Ruby Rod of Asmodeus. Underneath these expensive garments, the body was wracked with bleeding injuries. While he was in pain, he managed to give off the appearance of someone unconcerned with the pain the injuries caused him.",
      "Asmodeus was a lawful creature with the goal of becoming the supreme creature in the multiverse even if it required destroying the current multiverse and creating a new one. While the method he wanted to use to achieve this goal was not publicly known, and the only one who had the necessary knowledge to piece the method together hoped that it was not the one Asmodeus wanted to use, that Asmodeus wanted to take over the multiverse for himself was a known fact. He genuinely believed that a bright future awaited the multiverse, if he was to rule it. As arrogant this claim sounded, Asmodeus had the competence to back it up.",
      "When faced directly, he gave off the impression of a confident and eloquent man who was quite reasonable to talk with. In fact, it was quite difficult to see that he was an evil person past his manners that were the best found in Hell. His confidence was real and rooted in his knowledge to be one of the most powerful creatures in existence. However, he was not above pretending to know more than he did. Thus, he pretended to not just know but also foresee the actions of people who genuinely surprised him.",
      "Asmodeus ruled the entire plane of Baator. His seat of power was Nessus, the ninth layer. His serpentine body lay at the bottom of a rift called the Serpent's Coil.",
      "However, the denizens of this plane did not know about it. The blood that his wounded body gave off turned into new cornugons and pit fiends, usually the latter.",
      "He built up a big army over the years through this means. The army was stationed in Malsheem, a giant fortress so large that it was considered unmappable. As mentioned above, when meeting with others, he used of his humanoid looking avatars.",
      "The other archdevils were annually called to Malsheem. Asmodeus had a giant storage of souls in that citadel, which could be bought from him at an extremely high rate",
